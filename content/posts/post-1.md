For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by how children learn and equally, by how some children struggle when the education system doesn’t meet their needs. In my research on Special Educational Needs (SEN), I’ve come to believe that artificial intelligence (AI) can be one of the most powerful tools we have to bridge the gap between those who have access to personalised learning support and those who don’t.

In this article, I want to share how AI is already making a difference in SEN education in Europe, what the current challenges look like in Sri Lanka, and why I believe affordable AI powered tools could be the breakthrough our education system needs.

## How Europe Uses AI to Support SEN Learners

When I look at SEN provision in the UK and across Europe, the integration of AI-driven personalised learning is no longer experimental it’s becoming standard practice.

Platforms like Century Tech use AI to adapt learning material in real time, so students with different strengths and weaknesses get content that’s right for them. Carnegie Learning blends AI with cognitive science, creating targeted maths interventions that have helped students with dyscalculia gain confidence in problem solving. And Lexplore Analytics uses AI based eye tracking to detect reading difficulties early, allowing interventions to start before a child falls too far behind.

The key here is personalisation. These systems don’t just deliver the same lessons to every student they adapt, respond, and adjust based on individual needs.

## Sri Lanka’s Limited Use of EdTech for SEN

In contrast, Sri Lanka’s SEN support and particularly its use of technology is still in its early stages. In many schools, especially outside of major cities, children with learning difficulties receive no formal support.

Through my own observations and conversations with educators, I’ve seen several key challenges.

- Many rural schools have limited digital infrastructure.
- Teacher training in SEN-specific technology is rare.
- There are very few AI-based tools adapted to our curriculum or local languages.
- Costs make most international solutions inaccessible to families and schools.

This means that a child in Sri Lanka who has dyscalculia might never receive the same personalised, adaptive support that a child in London or Helsinki could access as part of their regular schooling.

## Learning from Europe -The Case for Affordable AI

I don’t believe we have to wait decades for Sri Lanka to build a perfect SEN infrastructure. AI gives us the chance to leapfrog some of the traditional barriers.

Here’s how:

1. **Offline First AI Platforms** – Tools that can run without a constant internet connection, syncing data only when online.
2. **Mobile First Delivery** – Since smartphones are more widely available than computers in Sri Lanka, learning apps should be designed primarily for mobile use.
3. **Open Source Frameworks** – We can adapt existing free AI platforms to match our curriculum and language needs.
4. **Public Private Partnerships** – Collaborations with telecom companies, NGOs, and tech innovators could subsidise access for low-income communities.
5. **Teacher Led Hybrid Models** – AI should work alongside trained teachers, not replace them, to ensure the best outcomes.

## Why This Matters Now

AI isn’t just about delivering lessons faster, it’s about identifying needs earlier, adapting to the learner in real time, and bridging the gap between urban and rural education.

Imagine a child in a remote Sri Lankan village using a mobile app that can detect their struggles with basic number sense and immediately adjust lessons to help them. Imagine that data being shared with a teacher who can then provide targeted, human support.

In Europe, these benefits are already being seen. In Sri Lanka, we have an opportunity to build solutions that fit our context and bring life-changing support to thousands of children who might otherwise slip through the cracks.

## Final Thoughts

The technology is here. The need is undeniable. What’s missing is the commitment to make AI SEN tools affordable, accessible, and locally relevant.

My vision is for Sri Lanka to learn from the success stories in Europe, not by copying them directly, but by adapting them to our culture, resources, and educational priorities. If we do this right, we can close decades of SEN learning gaps in just a few years.

I believe this is one of the most urgent and exciting opportunities in education today. And I want to be part of making it happen.

> If you’re an educator, policymaker, or EdTech innovator who shares this vision, I’d love to connect. Together, we can make personalised, inclusive learning a reality for every child.
