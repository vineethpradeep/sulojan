For decades, education systems have relied heavily on academic performance as a proxy for
intelligence. Test scores, grades, and exam rankings often define how learners are perceived.
Yet this approach overlooks a fundamental truth: intelligence is far broader than what
traditional assessments measure.

Many children with learning differences such as dyscalculia, ADHD, or maths anxiety
possess strong reasoning, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. However, when learning
environments fail to adapt to their needs, these strengths remain hidden. Repeated struggles
with standardised tasks can lead to frustration, disengagement, and self-doubt.

True intelligence expresses itself in diverse ways through curiosity, persistence, pattern
recognition, and innovative thinking. When education systems prioritise uniform outcomes
over individual learning pathways, they risk undervaluing these abilities.

Recognising intelligence beyond grades is not about lowering standards; it is about widening
perspectives. Inclusive education acknowledges that learners progress differently and that
understanding how a child learns is as important as measuring what they know.
