Dyscalculia is one of the least recognised learning difficulties, despite affecting millions of children worldwide. Often misunderstood, it is not about intelligence or effort, but about how the brain processes numerical information.

Children with dyscalculia may struggle with:

- Number sense and quantities.
- Basic arithmetic.
- Understanding time, money, or measurement.
- • Retaining mathematical concepts.

Because dyscalculia is less visible than other learning difficulties, many children go undiagnosed. This leads to frustration, emotional distress, and long-term academic disadvantage.

Inclusive education systems must move beyond one-size-fits-all teaching. Recognising diverse cognitive pathways allows educators to support children more effectively.

NeuroLearn AI is built on the belief that learning differences should be supported, not penalised, and that personalised approaches can help close long-standing educational gaps.
