Maths anxiety is not simply a dislike of numbers. It is an emotional response rooted in
repeated experiences of confusion, pressure, or failure. Over time, these experiences
condition learners to associate maths with stress rather than curiosity.

Children experiencing maths anxiety often know more than they can demonstrate. Under
pressure, their working memory becomes overloaded, making even simple tasks feel
overwhelming. This creates a cycle where fear impairs performance, reinforcing the belief
that they are “bad at maths.”

Breaking this cycle requires safe learning environments where mistakes are treated as part of
the learning process. Reducing time pressure, offering personalised pacing, and providing
supportive feedback can significantly improve outcomes.

When maths is reframed as a process of exploration rather than evaluation, confidence begins
to replace fear.
