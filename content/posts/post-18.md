Inclusion does not mean lowering standards. It means providing appropriate tools and
pathways so that all learners can achieve meaningful outcomes.

SEN learners often thrive when expectations are clear, support is structured, and progress is
recognised incrementally. When teaching adapts to how learners think, high expectations
become achievable rather than intimidating.

True inclusion challenges systems to be flexible while maintaining ambition for every learner.
