Dyscalculia remains one of the least understood learning difficulties, despite affecting a
significant number of learners worldwide. Often described as “maths dyslexia,” it impacts
number sense, memory, and the ability to process numerical information.

Unlike reading difficulties, dyscalculia frequently goes unnoticed for years. Children may be
labelled as careless, inattentive, or “not trying hard enough,” when in reality they are
struggling with a neurological difference. This misinterpretation can damage confidence and
increase anxiety around learning.

Early identification is crucial. When appropriate strategies are introduced — such as visual
supports, structured pacing, and adaptive feedback learners can build confidence and
competence. Dyscalculia does not reflect low intelligence; it reflects a difference in how
numerical information is processed.

Addressing this hidden crisis requires awareness, empathy, and teaching approaches that
recognise diversity in learning.
