Data in education is often misunderstood as simply test scores. In reality, meaningful learning
data includes patterns of engagement, response times, error trends, and learning preferences.

When used responsibly, data helps educators understand how learners interact with content
and where support is needed. It enables personalised pathways that adapt to individual
progress rather than enforcing uniform benchmarks.

Ethical, transparent use of data empowers learners and educators alike. It supports informed
decisions while respecting privacy and safeguarding principles.

Data should illuminate learning not reduce learners to numbers.
