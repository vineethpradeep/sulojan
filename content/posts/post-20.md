Success in education has long been defined by grades and rankings. However, true success
includes understanding, resilience, curiosity, and the ability to apply learning meaningfully.

Inclusive education calls for broader definitions of achievement ones that recognise growth,
effort, and individual progress. When success is redefined, more learners can see themselves
as capable and valued.

Education should empower every learner to succeed in their own way.
