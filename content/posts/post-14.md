The earlier learning difficulties are identified, the easier they are to address. Small gaps in
understanding, if left unsupported, often widen over time, leading to frustration and
disengagement.

Early intervention does not mean labelling children prematurely. It means observing learning
patterns, responding to early signs of struggle, and adapting instruction accordingly. Support
at this stage builds resilience and prevents long-term academic and emotional challenges.

Research consistently shows that targeted early support improves not only academic
outcomes but also self-esteem and motivation. Learners who feel understood are more willing
to engage and persist.

Early support is not an extra it is a foundation for inclusive education.
