Over the past few years, my journey has been shaped by a single question: How can we make learning work for every child, no matter how they process information or what challenges they face?

From my research on learning difficulties particularly those related to mathematics I’ve seen a pattern repeat itself across countries and cultures. Too many children are struggling in silence. Their difficulties are often misunderstood, misdiagnosed, or simply overlooked. And by the time anyone realises they need help, years of frustration and lost confidence have taken their toll.

I’ve written extensively about these challenges, comparing systems in Sri Lanka, Europe, and elsewhere. The more I’ve studied, the more convinced I’ve become that we need a new approach, one that’s inclusive, adaptive, and grounded in both empathy and evidence.ety early is crucial. It protects a child’s learning journey, boosts their self-belief, and opens doors to future success.

## Why I’m Building This Project

I’ve always believed that technology, when used thoughtfully, can be a bridge rather than a barrier. The right tools can meet learners where they are, adapt to their needs, and give them the confidence to succeed. But the technology alone isn’t enough, it needs to be combined with real human insight and a deep understanding of how different children learn.

Over the past year, I’ve been working quietly on the early stages of a platform that I believe can address these challenges in a meaningful way. I can’t share all the details yet, because the project is still in concept development and going through the process of seeking formal endorsement. What I can say is that it’s focused on making learning more accessible, more personalised, and more emotionally supportive for children who are often left behind by traditional education systems.

This is not about replacing teachers or schools, it’s about equipping them with better tools, so that every child, regardless of background or ability, has a fair chance to succeed.

### The Gaps I’m Trying to Fill

Maths anxiety is a common challenge for young people worldwide. Studies suggest a significant number of children, sometimes as many as one in four, struggle with these feelings. This issue isn’t limited to one country; it appears in diverse educational systems. Some cultures, with strong pressure for academic success, might even see higher levels of maths anxiety. This is due to intense competition or a belief that maths ability is fixed. Worryingly, this anxiety can start very young, sometimes even before formal schooling begins. Children in reception or primary school can show clear signs of maths-related fear.

## Causes of Maths Anxiety

In my research and discussions with educators, I’ve identified a few recurring gaps in the current system.

- **Late diagnosis of learning difficulties** – Many children, especially in developing nations, never receive proper assessment or support until it’s too late.
- **One-size-fits-all teaching methods** – Traditional classroom approaches often fail to adapt to different learning speeds and styles.
- **Lack of resources in low-income areas** – High-quality intervention tools are often too expensive or unavailable where they are needed most.
- **Emotional impact of repeated failure** – Children who struggle with certain subjects often lose confidence, which affects not just academics, but their overall life chances.

These issues aren’t unique to one country, they exist everywhere, from rural Sri Lanka to cities in Europe. But in some places, the support systems are stronger. In others, the gaps are so wide that they shape a child’s entire future.

### My Vision

I imagine a world where a child who struggles with numbers or reading doesn’t feel “less intelligent” than their peers. Where they can get support early, in a way that feels safe, encouraging, and tailored to their needs. Where teachers have access to clear, actionable insights about each student, without spending endless hours on manual tracking and guesswork.

I believe this is possible if we combine educational expertise, cutting-edge technology, and genuine empathy.

My aim is to build something that not only adapts to the learner’s needs in real time, but also considers their emotional wellbeing, cultural background, and long-term development. This will be a tool for educators, parents, and learners themselves—a way to make personalised support accessible to everyone, not just those in well-funded schools.

## Where I Am Now

Right now, the project is still in its concept and validation phase. I’m working on refining the idea, testing assumptions, and gathering input from educators, parents, and specialists. I’m also preparing to present the proposal to an endorsement body, which is a crucial step in moving from idea to reality.

During this stage, I’m being careful not to share the full technical details publicly. But behind the scenes, I’m mapping out the core features, development plan, and sustainability model to ensure the project can grow and make a real impact over time.

## Why This Matters to Me Personally

This isn’t just another tech project. It’s something I’ve been building towards for years. Through my blog, I’ve researched and written about:

- The hidden crisis of underdiagnosed learning difficulties
- The gaps in SEN education between countries
- How early intervention can change the trajectory of a child’s life
- The potential for AI and adaptive learning to bridge these gaps

Each article, each conversation, and each case study has reinforced my belief that we can and must do better for learners who don’t fit the traditional mould.

## How You Can Be Part of This

Although the project is still in development, I want this to be a collaborative journey. Over the coming months, I’ll be sharing insights, research, and small updates as I move through the endorsement process.

If you are:

- An educator with experience in special educational needs
- A parent of a child who has struggled in traditional classrooms
- A technologist or designer with a passion for inclusive education
- Or simply someone who believes every child deserves a fair chance
  …I’d love to hear from you.

Your feedback, encouragement, and even your critical questions can help shape this project into something truly valuable.

## A Final Word for Now

I believe the real test of any education system is not how it serves the top performers, but how it supports those who face the greatest challenges. That’s where the most meaningful change can happen.

This project is my attempt to make that change not in theory, but in practice. It’s still early days, but with the right support and collaboration, I believe we can create something that makes a tangible difference in the lives of thousands of children.

If you’d like to stay updated or be part of the journey, please get in touch with me. Together, we can take a step towards an education system that truly works for everyone.
